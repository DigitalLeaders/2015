    Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of lizards.
    The approximately 180 species of chameleon come in a range of colours, and many species have the ability to change colours.
    Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their very long, highly modified, rapidly extrudable tongues; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their distinctively shaped heads.
    Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail. Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.
    Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting. They are found in warm habitats that range from rain forest to desert conditions, various species occurring in Africa, Madagascar, southern Europe, and across southern Asia as far as Sri Lanka.
    They also have been introduced to Hawaii, California, and Florida, and often are kept as household pets.
